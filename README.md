# JavaFX_Proyects
Just learning JavaFX â˜• (idk if I like java that much so I'm gonna try)
1.- Representation of some algorithms (sorting, pathfinding) that I've learnt in my degree but the code that we made was silly and inefficient. Maybe I can use this to my Bachelor's thesis?
2.- Making any interesting proyect like these https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html (Super interesting!) I never thought about writting my own text editor, I tried long ago to build a MeterorDestroyer game in C#, but the abstractions of GameMaker made it not very educational at all. So, maybe a tetris in java?
3.- Using my knowledge of compilers to create a simple one, maybe it would be not very functional but I'm sure it's funny and I'll learn something.
